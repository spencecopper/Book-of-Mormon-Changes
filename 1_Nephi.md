1 Nephi 10



1 And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates of my proceedings, and my reign and ministry; wherefore, to proceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat of the things of my father, and also of my brethren. 

2 For behold, it came to pass that after my father had made an end of speaking the words of his dream, and also of exhorting them to all diligence, he spake unto them concerning the Jews: 

3 that after they were destroyed, yea, even that great city Jerusalem; and that many were carried away captive into Babylon; that according to the own due time of the Lord, they should return again; yea, even be brought back out of captivity; and after they are brought back out of captivity, to possess again the land of their inheritance. 

4 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a Prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews; yea, even a Messiah; or, in other words, a Saviour of the world. 

5 And he also spake concerning the prophets: How great a number had testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of which he had spoken, or this Redeemer of the world. 

6 Wherefore, all mankind was in a lost and in a fallen state; and ever would be, save they should rely on this Redeemer. 

7 And he spake also, concerning a prophet, which should come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord; 

8 yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And much spake my father concerning this thing. 

9 And my father saith that he should baptise in Bethabara, beyond Jordan; and he also spake, that he should baptise with water; yea, even that he should baptise the Messiah with water. 

10 And after that he had baptised the Messiah with water, he should behold and bear record, that he had baptised the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world. 

11 And it came to pass that after my father had spoken these words, he spake unto my brethren concerning the Gospel, which should be preached among the Jews; and also, concerning the dwindling of the Jews in unbelief. And after that they had slain the Messiah which should come, and after that he had been slain, he should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles. 

12 Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also concerning the House of Israel: That they should be compared like unto an olive tree, whose branches should be broken off, and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth. 

13 Wherefore, he said, it must needs be that we should  be led with one accord, into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of the Lord: That we should be scattered upon all the face of the earth. 

14 And after that the House of Israel should be scattered, they should be gathered together again; or, in fine, that after the Gentiles had received the fullness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree, or the remnants of the House of Israel, should be grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer. 

15 And after this manner of language did my father prophesy and speak unto my brethren; and also, many more things, which I do not write in this book; for I have written as many of them, as were expedient for me, in mine other book. 

16 And all these things of which I have spoken, was done, as my father dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel. 

17 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a vision; and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost; which power, he received by faith on the Son of God. And the Son of God was the Messiah, which should come. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, was desirous also, that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men; 

18 for he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the way is prepared from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him; 

19 for he that diligently seeketh, shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times, as in times of old; and as well in times of old, as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round. 

20 Therefore, remember, O man, for all thy doings, thou shalt be brought into judgment. 

21 Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever. 

22 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these things, and deny them not. 



1 Nephi 11



1 For it came to pass that after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me; wherefore, as I sat  pondering in mine heart, I was caught away in the spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceeding high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before sat my foot. 

2 And the spirit saith unto me, Behold, what desirest thou? 

3 And I saith, I desire to behold the things which my father saw. 

4 And the spirit saith unto me, Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken? 

5 And I said yea; thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father. 

6 And when I had spoken these words, the spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all; and blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the Most High God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired. 

7 And behold, this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign: that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of Heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after that ye have witnessed him, ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God. 

8 And it came to pass that the spirit saith unto me, look! and I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof, did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow. 

9 And it came to pass that after that I had seen the tree, I said unto the spirit, I behold thou hast shewn unto me the tree which is precious above all. 

10 And he saith unto me, What desirest thou? 

11 And I said unto him, to know the interpretation thereof; for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet, nevertheless, I knew that it was the spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another. 

12 And it came to pass that he said unto me, look: And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence. 

13 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceeding fair and white. 

14 And it came to pass that I saw the Heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he saith unto me, Nephi, what beholdest thou? 

15 And I saith unto him, a virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins. 

16 And he saith  unto me, Knowest thou the condescention of God? 

17 And I said unto him, I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things. 

18 And he said unto me, Behold, the virgin which thou seest, is the mother of God, after the manner of the flesh. 

19 And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the spirit; and after that she had been carried away in the spirit for the space of a time, the angel spake unto me, saying, look! 

20 And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms. 

21 And the angel said unto me, behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw? 

22 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things. 

23 And he spake unto me, saying, Yea, and the most joyous to the soul. 

24 And after that he had said these words, he said unto me, look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him. 

25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God. 

26 And the angel said unto me again, Look and behold the condescention of God! 

27 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of which my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet, which should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth, and was baptised of him; and after that he was baptised, I beheld the Heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of Heaven and abode upon him in the form of a dove. 

28 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them. 

29 And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that they were carried away in the spirit, from before my face, that I saw them not. 

30 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying, look! And I looked, and I beheld the Heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them. 

31 And he spake unto me again, saying, look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among  the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people which were sick, and which were afflicted of all manner of diseases, and with devils, and unclean spirits; and the angel spake, and shewed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out. 

32 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying, look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Everlasting God, was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record. 

33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross, and slain for the sins of the world. 

34 And after that he was slain, I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord. 

35 And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying, Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold, the House of Israel hath gathered together, to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 

36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell; and the fall thereof was exceeding great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 



1 Nephi 12



1 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me, Look, and behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren! And I looked and beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of people, yea, even as it were in number, as many as the sand of the sea. 

2 And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes gathered together, to battle one against the other; and I beheld wars, and rumors of wars, and great slaughters with the sword among my people. 

3 And it came to pass that I beheld many generations pass away, after the manner of wars and contentions in the land; and I beheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them. 

4 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face of the land of promise; and I saw lightnings, and I heard thunderings, and earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous  noises; and I saw the earth and the rocks, that they rent; and I saw mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the plains of the earth, that they were broken up; and I saw many cities, that they were sunk; and I saw many, that they were burned with fire; and I saw many, that they did tumble to the earth, because of the quaking thereof. 

5 And it came to pass that after I saw these things, I saw the vapor of darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I saw multitudes which had fallen, because of the great and terrible judgments of the Lord. 

6 And I saw the Heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of Heaven; and he came down and shewed himself unto them. 

7 And I also saw and bear record, that the Holy Ghost fell upon twelve others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen. 

8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the twelve disciples of the Lamb, which are chosen to minister unto thy seed. 

9 And he saith unto me, Thou remembereth the twelve apostles of the Lamb? Behold, they are they which shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, the twelve ministers of thy seed, shall be judged of them; for ye are of the house of Israel; 

10 and these twelve ministers which thou beholdest, shall judge thy seed. And behold, they are righteous forever; for because of their faith in the Lamb of God, their garments are made white in his blood. 

11 And the angel saith unto me, look! And I looked and beheld three generations did pass away in righteousness; and their garments were white, even like unto the Lamb of God. And the angel said unto me, These are made white in the blood of the Lamb, because of their faith in him. 

12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation, which did pass away in righteousness. 

13 And it came to pass that I saw the multitudes of the earth gathered together. 

14 And the angel said unto me, Behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren! 

15 And it came to pass that I looked, and beheld the people of my seed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my brethren; and they were gathered together to battle. 

16 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the fountain of filthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of which he spake; and the depths thereof, are the depths of hell; 

17 and the mists of darkness, are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that  they may perish, and are lost; 

18 and the large and spacious building which thy father saw, is vain imaginations, and the pride of the children of men. And a great and a terrible gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of the justice of the Eternal God, and Jesus Christ, which is the Lamb of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the beginning of the world until this time, and from this time henceforth and forever. 

19 And while the angel spoke these words, I beheld and saw that the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to the word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and the temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my brethren did overpower the people of my seed. 

20 And it came to pass that I beheld and saw the people of the seed of my brethren, that they had overcome my seed; and they went forth in multitudes upon the face of the land. 

21 And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw wars, and rumors of wars among them; and in wars, and rumors of wars, I saw many generations pass away. 

22 And the angel said unto me, behold, these shall dwindle in unbelief. 

23 And it came to pass that I beheld that after they had dwindled in unbelief, they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations. 



1 Nephi 13



1 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me saying, look! And I looked and beheld many nations and kingdoms. 

2 And the angel saith unto me, what beholdest thou? And I said I behold many nations and kingdoms. 

3 And he saith unto me, these are the nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles. 

4 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the Gentiles, the foundation of a great church. 

5 And the angel said unto me, Behold the foundation of a church, which is most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth the Saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into captivity. 

6 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church; and I saw the devil, that he was the founder of it. 

7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and fine twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw many harlots. 

8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine twined linen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this great and abominable church: 

9 and also for the praise of the world, do they destroy the Saints of God, and bring them down into captivity. 

10 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld many waters; and they divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren. 

11 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me, Behold, the wrath of God is upon the seed of thy brethren! 

12 And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, which was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, which were in the promised land. 

13 And it came to pass that I beheld the spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters. 

14 And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles, upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles, and they were smitten. 

15 And I beheld the spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles; that they did prosper, and obtain the land of their inheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceeding fair and beautiful, like unto my people, before that they were slain. 

16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles which had gone forth out of captivity, did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them; 

17 and I beheld that their mother Gentiles was gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them; 

18 and I beheld that the power of God was with them; and also, that the wrath of God was upon them, that were gathered together against them to battle. 

19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles which had gone out of captivity, were delivered by the power of God, out of the hands of all other nations. 

20 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the land; and I beheld a Book; and it was carried forth among them. 

21 And the angel saith unto me, Knowest thou the meaning of the Book? 

22 And I saith unto him, I know not. 

23 And he saith, Behold, it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew, and I, Nephi, beheld it; and he saith unto me, The Book which thou beholdest, is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord which he hath made unto the House of Israel; and it also containeth many of the prophecies of the Holy Prophets; and it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the plates of brass, save there are not so many:  nevertheless, they contain the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the House of Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles. 

24 And the angel of the Lord said unto me, Thou hast beheld that the Book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; it contained the plainness of the Gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles bear record; and they bear record according to the truth which is in the Lamb of God; 

25 wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity, unto the Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God; 

26 and after that they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles; behold, after this, thou seest the foundation of a great and abominable church, which is the most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have taken away from the Gospel of the Lamb, many parts which are plain and most precious; and also, many Covenants of the Lord have they taken away; 

27 and all this have they done, that they might pervert the right ways of the Lord; that they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the children of men; 

28 wherefore, thou seest that after the Book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and precious things taken away from the Book, which is the Book of the Lamb of God; 

29 and after that these plain and precious things were taken away, it goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles, yea, even across the many waters which thou hast seen with the Gentiles which have gone forth out of captivity; and thou seest because of the many plain and precious things which have been taken out of the Book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children of men, according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of God; and because of these things which are taken away out of the Gospel of the Lamb, an exceeding great many do stumble, yea, insomuch that Satan hath great power over them; 

30 nevertheless thou beholdest that the Gentiles which have gone forth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of God above all other nations upon the face of the land, which is choice above all other lands, which is the land which the Lord God hath covenanted with thy father, that his seed should have, for the land of their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the Lord God will not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed, which is among thy brethren; 

31 neither  will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the seed of thy brethren; 

32 neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall forever remain in that state of awful woundedness which thou beholdest that they are in, because of the plain and most precious parts of the Gospel of the Lamb which hath been kept back by that abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen; 

33 wherefore, saith the Lamb of God, I will be merciful unto the Gentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the House of Israel in great judgment. 

34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after that I have visited the remnant of the House of Israel, and this remnant of which I speak, is the seed of thy father; wherefore, after that I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles; and after that the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the Gospel of the Lamb which hath been kept back, by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb; wherefore, I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, saith the Lamb, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them in mine own power, much of my Gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb; 

35 for behold, saith the Lamb, I will manifest myself unto thy seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister unto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after that thy seed shall be destroyed and dwindle in unbelief, and also, the seed of thy brethren; behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb; 

36 and power of the Lamb; and in them shall be written my Gospel, saith the Lamb, and my rock and my salvation; 

37 and blessed are they which shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end, they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the Everlasting Kingdom of the Lamb; yea, whoso shall publish peace, that shall publish tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be. 

38 And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew; and I beheld that it came forth from the Gentiles, unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren; 

39 and after it had come forth unto them, I beheld other Books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles, unto them, unto the convincing of the  Gentiles, and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also to the Jews, which were scattered upon all the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, are true. 

40 And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which is of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Eternal Father and the Saviour of the world; and that all men must come unto Him, or they cannot be saved; 

41 and they must come according to the words which shall be established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb shall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the records of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore, they shall be established in one, for there is one God and one Shepherd over all the earth; 

42 and the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all nations, both unto the Jews, and also unto the Gentiles; and after that he hath manifested himself unto the Jews, and also unto the Gentiles, then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles, and also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first, and the first shall be last. 



1 Nephi 14



1 And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken unto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself unto them in word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the taking away of their stumbling blocks, 

2 and if it so be that they harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, they shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall be numbered among the House of Israel; and they shallbe a blest people upon the promised land forever; they shall be no more brought down into captivity; and the House of Israel shall no more be confounded; 

3 and that great pit which hath been digged for them, by that great and abominable church, which was founded by the Devil and his children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to Hell; yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the destruction of men, shall be filled by those who digged it, unto their utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of the soul, save it be the casting of it into that Hell which hath no end; 

4 for behold, this is according to the captivity of the  Devil, and also according to the justice of God, upon all those who will work wickedness and abomination before him. 

5 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi, saying: Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent, it shall be well with them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto the House of Israel; and thou also hast heard, that whoso repenteth not, must perish; 

6 therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles, if it so be that they harden their hearts against the Lamb of God: 

7 for the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a marvellous work among the children of men; a work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other; either to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds, unto their being brought down into captivity, and also unto destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the captivity of the Devil, of which I have spoken. 

8 And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these words, he saith unto me, Remember thou the covenants of the Father unto the House of Israel? I saith unto him, yea. 

9 And it came to pass that he saith unto me, Look, and behold that great and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose foundation is the Devil. 

10 And he saith unto me, Behold, there is, save it be, two churches: the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the Devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God, belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth. 

11 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. 

12 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore which sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, which were the Saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominion upon the face of the earth was small, because of the wickedness of the great whore which I saw. 

13 And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of  the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God. 

14 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, which were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory. 

15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon the great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth; 

16 and as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and, behold, thou seest all these things! 

17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the Devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people, which are of the House of Israel. 

18 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying, Look! 

19 And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white robe; 

20 and the angel said unto me, Behold one of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb! 

21 Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things; yea, and also many things which have been; 

22 and he shall also write concerning the end of the world; 

23 wherefore, the things which he shall write, are just and true; and behold, they are written in the book which thou beheld proceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were written, were plain and pure, and most precious, and easy to the understanding of all men. 

24 And, behold, the things which this Apostle of the Lamb shall write, are many things which thou hast seen; and, behold, the remainder shalt thou see; 

25 but the things which thou shalt see hereafter, thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained the Apostle of the Lamb of God, that he should write them. 

26 And also, others which have been to them, hath he shown all things, and they have written them; and they are sealed up, to come forth in their purity, according to the truth which is  in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the House of Israel. 

27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the Apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel. 

28 And, behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore, the things which I have written, sufficeth me; and I have not written but a small part of the things which I saw. 

29 And I bear record, that I saw the things which my father saw, and the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.- 

30 And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which I saw, while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the things which I saw are not written, the things which I have written, are true. And thus it is. Amen. 



1 Nephi 15



1 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away in the spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the tent of my father. 

2 And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were disputing one with another, concerning the things which my father had spoken unto them; 

3 for he truly spake many great things unto them, which was hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they had ought. 

4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and knew they must unavoidably come to pass, because of the great wickedness of the children of men. 

5 And it came to pass that I was overcome because of my afflictions, for I considered that mine afflictions were great above all, because of the destructions of my people; for I had beheld their fall. 

6 And it came to pass that after I had received strength, I spake unto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their disputations. 

7 And they said, Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the olive tree, and also, concerning the Gentiles. 

8 And I said unto them, Have ye inquired of the Lord? 

9 And they said unto me, we have not; for the Lord maketh no  such thing known unto us. 

10 Behold, I said unto them, How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts? 

11 Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said: If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely, these things shall be made known unto you? 

12 Behold, I say unto you, that the House of Israel was compared unto an olive tree, by the spirit of the Lord which was in our fathers; and, behold, are we not broken off from the House of Israel; and are we not a branch of the House of Israel? 

13 And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many generations, after that the Messiah hath manifested himself in body unto the children of men, then shall the fulness of the Gospel of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed; 

14 and at that day, shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the House of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the Gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer, and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved. 

15 And then at that day, will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment from the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God? 

16 Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again among the House of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a natural branch of the olive tree, into the true olive tree; 

17 and this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not come to pass, until after that they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that the Lord may shew his power unto the Gentiles, for the very cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the House of Israel; 

18 wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the House of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter days; which cove nant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 

19 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the restoration of the Jews, in the latter days; 

20 and I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, which spake concerning the restoration of the Jews, or of the House of Israel; and after that they were restored, they should no more be confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they were pacified, and did humble themselves before the Lord. 

21 And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again, saying: What meaneth the thing which our father saw in a dream? What meaneth the tree which he saw? 

22 And I said unto them, it was a representation of the tree of life. 

23 And they said unto me, What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree? 

24 And I said unto them, that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the firy darts of the adversary, overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction. 

25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God, and remember to keep his commandments always, in all things.- 

26 And they said unto me, What meaneth the river of water which our father saw? 

27 And I said unto them, that the water which my father saw, was filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things, that he beheld not the filthiness of the water; 

28 and I said unto them, that it was an awful gulf, which separateth the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the Saints of God; 

29 and I said unto them, that it was a representation of that awful Hell, which the angel said unto me was prepared for the wicked. 

30 And I said unto them, that our father also saw, that the justice of God did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and the brightness thereof was like unto the brightness of a flaming fire, which ascendeth up unto God forever and ever, and hath no end. 

31 And they said unto me, Doth this thing mean the torment of the body is in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final state of the soul after the death of the temporal body? or doth  it speak of the things which are temporal? 

32 And it came to pass that I said unto them, That it was a representation of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day should come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even the works which were done by the temporal body in their days of probation; 

33 wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness, they must be cast off; also as to the things which are spiritual, which are pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand before God, to be judged of their works; and if their works have been filthiness, they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy, it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, The kingdom of God must be filthy also. 

34 But, behold, I say unto you, The kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore, there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy. 

35 And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful Hell of which I have spoken, and the Devil is the preparator of it; wherefore, the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that justice of which I have spoken; 

36 wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and also from that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and most desirable above all other fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spake unto my brethren.- Amen. 



1 Nephi 16



1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my brethren, behold, they said unto me, Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than that which we are able to bear. 

2 And it came to pass that I said unto them, That I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very centre. 

3 And now, my brethren, if ye were righteous, and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say thou speakest hard things against  us. 

4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren, with all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord. 

5 And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord; insomuch, that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they would walk in the paths of righteousness. 

6 Now, all these things were said and done, as my father dwelt in a tent in the valley which he called Lemuel. 

7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, Zoram took the eldest daghter of Ishmael to wife. 

8 And thus my father had fulfilled all the commandments of the Lord, which had been given unto him. And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed of the Lord, exceedingly. 

9 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my father, by night, and commanded him, that on the morrow, he should take his journey into the wilderness. 

10 And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment, he beheld upon the ground a round ball, of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness. 

11 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever things we should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder of our provisions which the Lord had given unto us; and we did take seed of every kind, that we might carry into the wilderness. 

12 And it came to pass that we did take our tents, and depart into the wilderness, across the river Laman. 

13 And it came to pass that we travelled for the space of four days, nearly a south, southeast direction, and we did pitch our tents again; and we did call the name of the place Shazer. 

14 And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows, and go forth into the wilderness, to slay food for our families; and after that we had slain food for our families, we did return again to our families in the wilderness, to the place of Shazer. And we did go forth again, in the wilderness, following the same direction, keeping in the most fertile parts of the wilderness, which was in the borders near the Red Sea. 

15 And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows, and our stones, and our slings; 

16 and we did follow the direc tions of the ball, which led us in the more fertile parts of the wilderness. 

17 And after that we had travelled for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents for the space of a time, that we might again rest ourselves and obtain food for our families. 

18 And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel; and after that I did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me, because of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food. 

19 And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families. And being much fatigued, because of their journeying, they did suffer much for the want of food. 

20 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness; and also, my father began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceeding sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the Lord. 

21 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with my brethren, because of the loss of my bow; and their bows having lost their springs, it began to be exceeding difficult, yea, insomuch, that we could obtain no food. 

22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my brethren, because that they had hardened their hearts again, even unto complaining against the Lord their God. 

23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling, and with stones. And I said unto my father, Whither shall I go, to obtain food? 

24 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they had humbled themselves because of my word; for I did say many things unto them in the energy of my soul. 

25 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch, that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow. 

26 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him, Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written! 

27 And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things which were written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble exceedingly; and also my brethren, and the sons of Ishmael, and our wives. 

28 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith, and diligence, and heed, which we did give unto them. 

29 And there was also written upon them, a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it: And thus we see, that by small means, the Lord can bring about great things. 

30 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given upon the ball. 

31 And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, insomuch, that I did obtain food for our families.- 

32 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the beasts which I had slain; and now, when they beheld that I had obtained food, how great was their joy. And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks unto him. 

33 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, travelling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after that we had travelled for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space of a time. 

34 And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the place which was called Nahom. 

35 And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, because that he had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings, we must perish in the wilderness with hunger. 

36 And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; and they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem. 

37 And Laman saith unto Lemuel, and also unto the sons of Ishmael, Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who hath taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren. 

38 Now, he saith that the Lord hath talked with him, and also, that angels hath ministered unto him! But behold, we know that he lieth unto us; and he telleth us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after that he hath led us away, he hath thought to make himself a King and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure.  And after this manner, did my brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger. 

39 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us; yea, even the voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did chasten them exceedingly; and after that they were chastened by the voice of the Lord, they did turn away their anger, and did repent of their sins, insomuch, that the Lord did bless us again with food, that we did not perish. 



1 Nephi 17



1 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward, from that time forth. And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness. 

2 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings. 

3 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God, he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he hath commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness. 

4 And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even eight years in the wilderness. 

5 And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because of its much fruit, and also, wild honey; and all these things were prepared of the Lord, that we might not perish.- And we beheld the Sea, which we called Irreantum, which being interpreted, is, many waters. 

6 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the seashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions, and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore; and we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit. 

7 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord. 

8 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters. 

9 And I saith, Lord, whither shall I go, that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship, after the manner which thou hast shewn unto me? 

10 And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools. 

11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make bellowses wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after that I had made bellowses, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together, that I might make fire, 

12 for the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he saith, I will make that thy food shall become sweet, that ye cook it not; 

13 and I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led. 

14 Yea, and the Lord said also, that after ye have arrived to the promised land, ye shall know that I, the Lord, am God; and that I, the Lord, did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem; 

15 wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the commandments of the Lord, and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and diligence. 

16 And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I did molten out of the rock. 

17 And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters. 

18 And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord. 

19 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was exceeding sorrowful, because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when they saw that I began to be sorrowful, they were glad in their hearts, insomuch, that they did rejoice over me, saying: We knew that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so great a work; 

20 and thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem; and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the  wilderness, and suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died, before they came out of Jerusalem, than to have suffered these afflictions. 

21 Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness, which time we might have enjoyed our possessions, and the land of our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy; 

22 and we know that the people which were in the land of Jerusalem were a righteous people; for they kept the statutes and the judgments of the Lord, and all his commandments, according to the law of Moses; wherefore, we know that they are a righteous people; and our father hath judged them, and hath led us away because we would hearken unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto him. And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur and complain against us. 

23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying: Do ye believe that our fathers, which were the children of Israel, would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians, if they had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord? 

24 Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of bondage, if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead them out of bondage? 

25 Now ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and ye know that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore, ye know that it must needs be a good thing for them, that they should be brought out of bondage. 

26 Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that great work; and ye know that by his word, the waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and thither, and they passed through on dry ground. 

27 But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, which were the armies of Pharaoh; 

28 and ye also know that they were fed with manna, in the wilderness; 

29 yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word, according to the power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth water, that the children of Israel might quench their thirst; 

30 and notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day, and giving light unto them by night, and doing all things for them which was expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts, and blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the true and living God. 

31 And it came to pass that according to his word, he did destroy them; and according to his word, he did lead them; and according to his word, he did do all things for them; and  there was not any thing done, save it were by his word. 

32 And after they had crossed the river Jordan, he did make them mighty, unto the driving out the children of the land, yea, unto the scattering them to destruction. 

33 And now do ye suppose that the children of this land, which were in the land of promise, which were driven out by our fathers, do ye suppose that they were righteous? Behold, I say unto you, nay. 

34 Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been more choice than they, if they had been righteous? I say unto you, nay, 

35 behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one: He that is righteous, is favored of God. But, behold, this people had rejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction; and he did bless it unto our fathers, unto their obtaining power over it. 

36 Behold, the Lord hath created the earth, that it should be inhabited; and he hath created his children, that they should possess it. 

37 And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the nations of the wicked. 

38 And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and the wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for their sakes. 

39 He ruleth high in the Heavens, for it is his throne, and this earth is his footstool. 

40 And he loveth them which will have him to be their God. Behold, he loved our fathers; and he covenanted with them, yea, even Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land of Egypt, 

41 and he did straighten them in the wilderness with his rod, for they hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straightened them, because of their iniquity. He sent firy- flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten, he prepared a way, that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to perform, was to look! and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many which perished. 

42 And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they did revile against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, ye know that they were led forth by his matchless power, into the land of promise.- 

43 And now, after all these things, the time has come that they have become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but they are at this day about to be destroyed, for I know that the day must surely come, that they must be destroyed, save a few only, which shall be led away into captivity; 

44  wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he should depart into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his life; yea, and ye also have sought to take away his life; wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts, and ye are like unto they: 

45 ye are like unto they: Ye are swift to do iniquity, but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still, small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words; wherefore, he hath spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder. 

46 And ye also know, that by the power of his Almighty word, he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that by his word, he can cause that rough places be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts? 

47 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my heart is pained: I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever. Behold, I am full of the spirit of God, insomuch as if my frame had no strength. 

48 And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words, they were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the depths of the Sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon me, I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay their hands upon me, shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as nought before the power of God, for God shall smite him. 

49 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, saith unto them, That they should murmur no more against their father; neither should they withhold their labor from me, for God had commanded me that I should build a ship. 

50 And I saith unto them, If God had commanded me to do all things, I could do it. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, Be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done. 

51 And now, if the Lord hath such great power, and hath wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship? 

52 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my brethren, insomuch that they were confounded, and could not contend against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon  me, nor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days. Now they durst not do this, lest they should wither before me, so powerful was the spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon them. 

53 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me, Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither before thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord; and this will I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God. 

54 And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my brethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did shake them, even according to the word which he had spoken. 

55 And now, they said, We know of a surety, that the Lord is with thee, for we know that it is the power of the Lord that hath shaken us. And they fell down before me, and were about to worship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee. 



1 Nephi 18



1 And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go forth with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did shew me from time to time, after what manner I should work the timbers of the ship. 

2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shewn unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men. 

3 And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore, the Lord shewed unto me great things. 

4 And it came to pass that after I had finished the ship according to the word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was good, and that the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine; wherefore, they did humble themselves again before the Lord. 

5 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father, that we should arise and go down into the ship.- 

6 And it came to pass that on the morrow, after that we had prepared all things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey in abundance, and provisions, according to that which the Lord had commanded us, we did go down into the ship with all our loading and our seeds, and whatsoever  thing we had brought with us, every one according to his age; wherefore, we did all go down into the ship, with our wives and our children. 

7 And now, my father had begat two sons, in the wilderness: The eldest was called Jacob, and the younger, Joseph. 

8 And it came to pass that after we had all gone down into the ship, and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been commanded us, we did put forth into the sea, and were driven forth before the wind, towards the promised land; 

9 and after that we had been driven forth before the wind, for the space of many days, behold, my brethren, and the sons of Ishmael, and also their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness, yea, even to that they did forget by what power they had been brought thither; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness. 

10 And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly, lest the Lord should be angry with us, and smite us, because of our iniquity, that we should be swallowed up in the depths of the Sea; wherefore, I, Nephi, began to speak to them with much soberness; but, behold, they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger brother shall be a ruler over us. 

11 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it, that he might shew forth his power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he hath spoken, concerning the wicked. 

12 And it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of the Lord, did cease to work; 

13 wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship, insomuch, that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest; and we were driven back upon the waters for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly, lest they should be drowned in the Sea; nevertheless, they did loose me 

14 And on the fourth day which we had been driven back, the tempest began to be exceeding sore. 

15 And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the Sea. And after that we had been driven back upon the waters for the space of four days, my brethren began to see that the judgment of God was upon them, and that they must perish, save that they should repent of their iniquities; wherefore, they came unto me and loosed the bands  which was upon my wrists, and behold, they had much swolen, exceedingly; and also, mine ancles were much swollen, and great was the soreness thereof. 

16 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord, because of mine afflictions. 

17 Now, my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and also unto the sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much threatnings against any one that should speak for me; and my parents being stricken in years, and having suffered much grief because of their children, they were brought down, yea, even upon their sick beds. 

18 Because of their grief, and much sorrow, and the iniquity of my brethren, they were brought near even to be carried out of this time, to meet their God; yea, their gray hairs were about to be brought down to lie low in the dust; yea, even they were near to be cast into a watery grave. 

19 And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much nourishment, were grieved because of the afflictions of their mother; and also my wife, with her tears and prayers, and also my children, did not soften the hearts of my brethren, that they would loose me; 

20 and there was nothing, save it were the power of God, which threatened them with destruction, could soften their hearts; wherefore, when they saw that they were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea, they repented of the thing which they had done, insomuch that they loosed me. 

21 And it came to pass that after they had loosed me, behold, I took the compass, and it did work whither I desired it. And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after that I had prayed, the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm. 

22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land. 

23 And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days, we did arrive to the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land. 

24 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in abundance. 

25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the Land of Promise, as we journied in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow, and the ox, and the  ass, and the horse, and the goat, and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And we did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper. 



1 Nephi 19



1 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore, that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made, I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also, many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them. 

2 And I knew not at that time when I made them, that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness, are engraven upon those plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before that I made these plates, are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates. 

3 And after that I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment, that the ministry, and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written, should be kept for the instruction of my people, which should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes, are known unto the Lord; 

4 wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates, which gives an account, or which gives a greater account, of the wars, and contentions, and destructions of my people. And this have I done, and commanded my people that they should do, after that I was gone, and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to another, until further commandments of the Lord. 

5 And an account of my making these plates shall be given hereafter; and then, behold, I proceed according to that which I have spoken; and this I do, that the more sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people. 

6 Nevertheless, I do not write any thing upon plates, save it be that I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old. Not that I would excuse myself because of other men, but because of the weakness which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself. 

7 For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the body and soul, others set at nought, and trample under their feet. Yea, even the  very God of Israel, do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet; but I would speak in other words: They do set him at nought, and hearken not to the voice of his counsels; 

8 and behold, he cometh according to the words of the angel, in six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem. 

9 And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of nought; wherefore, they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long suffering towards the children of men. 

10 And the God of our fathers, which were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him; yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, and according to the words of Zenos, which he spake, concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of his death, unto them who should inhabit the isles of the sea; more especially given unto them which are of the House of Israel. 

11 For thus spake the Prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit all the House of Israel at that day: some with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation; and others, with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapour of darkness, and by the opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up; 

12 and all these things must surely come, saith the Prophet Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must rend; and because of the groanings of the earth, many of the Kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought upon by the spirit of God, to exclaim, The God of nature suffers. 

13 And as for they which are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet, shall be scourged by all people, saith the prophet, because they crucify the God of Israel, and turned their hearts aside, rejecting signs, and wonders, and power and glory of the God of Israel; 

14 and because they turned their hearts aside, saith the prophet, and have despised the Holy one of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all nations; 

15 nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that they no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy one of Israel, then will he remember the covenants which he made to their fathers; 

16 yea,  then will he remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all the people which are of the House of Israel, will I gather in, saith the Lord, according to the words of the Prophet Zenos, from the four quarters of the earth; 

17 yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord, saith the prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, shall be blessed. 

18 And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that perhaps I might persuade them that they would remember the Lord their Redeemer; 

19 wherefore, I speak unto all the House of Israel, if it so be that they should obtain these things. 

20 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary me, even that all my joints are weak, for they which are at Jerusalem; for had not the Lord been merciful, to shew unto me concerning them, even as he had prophets of old; 

21 for he surely did shew unto the prophets of old, all things concerning them; and also, he did shew unto many, concerning us; wherefore, it must needs be, that we know concerning them, for they are written upon the plates of brass. 

22 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren these things. And it came to pass that I did read many things to them, which were engraven upon the plates of brass, that they might know concerning the doings of the Lord in other lands, among people of old. 

23 And I did read many things unto them, which were written in the Book of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their Redeemer, wherefore I did read unto them that which was written by the Prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning. 

24 Wherefore, I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the prophet, ye which are a remnant of the House of Israel, a branch of which have been broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which was written unto all the House of Israel, and liken it unto yourselves, that ye may have hope as well as your brethren, from whom ye have been broken off. For after this manner hath the prophet written: 



1 Nephi 20



1 Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God  of Israel; yet they swear not in truth, nor in righteousness.- 

2 Nevertheless, they call themselves of the Holy city, but they do not stay themselves upon the God of Israel, which is the Lord of hosts; yea, the Lord of hosts is his name. 

3 Behold, I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did shew them suddenly. 

4 And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck was an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; 

5 and I have, even from the beginning, declared to thee; before it came to pass I shewed them thee; and I shewed them for fear lest thou shouldst say, Mine idol hath done them; and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. 

6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare them? And that I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. 

7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not, they were declared unto thee, lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them. 

8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time, thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. 

9 Nevertheless, for my name sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off. 

10 For, behold, I have refined thee; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. 

11 For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake, will I do this; for I will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory unto another. 

12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; for I am he; and I am the first, and I am also the last. 

13 Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: and I called unto them, and they stand up together. 

14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things unto them? The Lord hath loved him: yea, and he will fulfil his word which he hath declared by them; and he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans. 

15 Also, saith the Lord: I the Lord, yea, I have spoken, yea, I have called him, to declare I have brought him; and he shall make his way prosperous. 

16 Come ye near unto me: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was declared, have I spoken; and the Lord God, and his spirit, hath sent me. 

17 And  thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I have sent him, the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done it. 

18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: 

19 thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me. 

20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.- 

21 And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he cleaved the rock also, and the waters gushed out. 

22 And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also, There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked. 



1 Nephi 21



1 And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken off and are driven out, because of the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that are scattered abroad, which are of my people, O house of Israel. Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; the Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name. 

2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; 

3 and said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. 

4 Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain; surely, my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God. 

5 And now, saith the Lord, that formed me from the womb that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength. 

6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.- 

7 Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nations abhorreth, to servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful. 

8 Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O  isles of the sea, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee my servant for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages: 

9 that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that sit in darkness, Shew yourselves.- They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places. 

10 They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. 

11 And I will make all my mountains away, and my highways shall be exalted. 

12 And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. 

13 Sing, O Heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of them which are in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for they shall be smitten no more: for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted. 

14 But, behold, Zion hath said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me; but he will shew that he hath not. 

15 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel. 

16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me. 

17 Thy children shall make haste against thy destroyers; and they that made thee waste, shall go forth of thee. 

18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on even as a bride. 

19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants; and they that swallowed thee up, shall be far away. 

20 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall again in thine ears say, The place is too straight for me: give place to me that I may dwell. 

21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where have they been? 

22 Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be  carried upon their shoulders. 

23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. 

24 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives delivered? 

25 But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. 

26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob. 



1 Nephi 22



1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, after that I had read these things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me and said unto me, What meaneth these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things which are spiritual, which shall come to pass according to the spirit and not the flesh? 

2 And I, Nephi, sayeth unto them, Behold, they were made manifest unto the prophet, by the voice of the spirit: for by the spirit are all things made known unto the prophet, which shall come upon the children of men, according to the flesh. 

3 Wherefore, the things of which I have read, are things pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual: for it appears that the House of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the earth, and also among all nations, 

4 and before there are many which are already lost from the knowledge of they which are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of the sea: and whither they are, none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.- 

5 And since that they have been led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all they which shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel: for against him will they harden their hearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all nations,  and shall be hated by all men. 

6 Nevertheless, after that they have been nursed by the Gentiles, and the Lord hath lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a standard, and their children shall be carried in their arms, and their daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders, behold, these things of which are spoken, are temporal: for thus is the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days to come, and also all our brethren which are of the House of Israel. 

7 And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the House of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them shall our seed be scattered. 

8 And after that our seed is scattered, the Lord God will proceed to do a marvellous work among the Gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto the being nourished by the Gentiles, and being carried in their arms, and upon their shoulders. 

9 And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles, but unto all the House of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of Heaven unto Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 

10 And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed, unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. 

11 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his Gospel, unto they which are of the House of Israel. 

12 Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity, and out of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Saviour and their Redeemer, the mighty one of Israel. 

13 And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads: for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood. 

14 And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall fall into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that fight against Zion, shall be destroyed. And that great whore, which hath perverted the right ways of the Lord; yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust, and great shall be the fall of it. 

15 For behold, saith the prophet, that the time  cometh speedily, that Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of men: for the day soon cometh, that all the proud and they which do wickedly, shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must be burned. 

16 For the time soon cometh, that the fulness of the wrath of God shall be poured out upon all the children of men: for he will not suffer that the wicked shall destroy the righteous. 

17 Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if it so be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not fear: for thus saith the prophet, They shall be saved, even if it so be as by fire. 

18 Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these things must shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh unto men according to the flesh, if it so be that they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel: 

19 for behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must come, that all they which fight against Zion, shall be cut off. 

20 And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all they which will not hear that prophet, shall be cut off from among the people. 

21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of whom Moses spake, was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall execute judgment in righteousness; 

22 and the righteous need not fear, for it is they which shall not be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the Devil, which shall be built up among the children of men, which kingdom is established among them which are in the flesh: 

23 for the time speedily shall come, that all churches which are built up to get gain, and all they which are built up to get power over the flesh, and they which are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and they which seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all they which belong to the kingdom of the Devil, it is they which need fear, and tremble, and quake; it is they which must be brought low in the dust; it is they which must be consumed as stubble: and this is according to the words of the prophet. 

24 And the time cometh speedily, that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and the Holy One  of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power, and great glory. 

25 And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture.- 

26 And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan hath no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years: for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel reigneth. 

27 And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you, that all these things must come, according to the flesh. 

28 But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, shall dwell safely in the Holy One of Israel, if it so be that they will repent. 

29 And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not speak further as yet, concerning these things. 

30 Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that the things which have been written upon the plates of brass, are true; and they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God. 

31 Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and also taught them. Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen. 



2 Nephi 01



1 And now it came to pass after I, Nephi, had made an end of teaching my brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many things unto them: how great things the Lord had done for them, in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem. 

2 And he spake unto them concerning their rebellions upon the waters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were not swallowed up in the sea. 

3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise, which they had obtained: how merciful the Lord had been in warning us that we should flee  out of the land of Jerusalem. 

4 For, Behold, saith he, I have seen a vision, in the which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem, we should also have perished. 

5 But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever; and also all they which should be led out of other countries, by the hand of the Lord. 

6 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prohesy according to the workings of the spirit which is in me, that there shall be none come into this land, save they should be brought by the hand of the Lord. 

7 Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity: if so, it shall be because of iniquity: for if iniquity shall abound, cursed shall be the land for their sakes; but unto the righteous, it shall be blessed forever. 

8 And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations: for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance. 

9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as they which the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments, they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely forever. 

10 But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in unbelief, after that they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord; having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men knowing the great and marvellous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise; behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is just, shall rest upon them; 

11 yea, he will bring other nations unto them,  and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions; and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten. 

12 Yea, as one generation passeth to another, there shall be bloodsheds and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons, I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken unto my words. 

13 O that ye would awake, awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and wo! 

14 Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveller can return: a few more days, and I go the way of all the earth. 

15 But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell: I have beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love. 

16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the statutes and the judgments of the Lord: behold, this hath been the anxiety of my soul, from the beginning. 

17 My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to time: for I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts, lest the Lord your God should come out in the fulness of his wrath, upon you, that ye be cut off and destroyed forever; 

18 or, that a cursing should come upon you, for the space of many generations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are hated, and are led according to the will and captivity of the Devil. 

19 O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but that ye might be a choice and a favored people of the Lord. But, behold, his will be done: for his ways are righteousness forever; 

20 and he hath said, that inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments, ye shall be cut off from my presence. 

21 And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my heart might leave this world with gladness because of you; that I might not be brought down with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise from the dust, my sons, and be men, and be determined in one mind, and in one heart united in all things, that ye may not come down into captivity; 

22 that ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that ye may not incur the displeasure of a just God upon you, unto the destruction, yea, the eternal destruction of both soul and body. 

23 Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which  ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. 

24 Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been glorious, and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem, and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in bringing us forth into the land of promise: for were it not for him, we must have perished with hunger in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to take away his life; yea, and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you. 

25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he shall suffer again: for behold, ye have accused him that he sought power and authority over you; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you; but he hath sought the glory of God, and your own eternal welfare. 

26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you. Ye say that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you. But behold, his sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye call anger, was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not constrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities. 

27 And it must needs be that the power of God must be with him, even unto his commanding you, that ye must obey. But behold, it was not him, but it was the spirit of the Lord which was in him, which opened his mouth to utterance, that he could not shut it. 

28 And now my son Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my sons which are the sons of Ishmael, behold, if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi, ye shall not perish. And if ye will hearken unto him, I leave unto you a blessing, yea, even my first blessing. 

29 But if ye will not hearken unto him, I take away my first blessing, yea, even my blessing, and it shall rest upon him. 

30 And now, Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the servant of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true friend unto my son, Nephi, forever. 

31 Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful, thy seed shall be blessed with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever.- 

32 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son. 



2 Nephi 02



1 And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my first born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood, thou hast suf fered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren. 

2 Nevertheles, Jacob, my first born in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain. 

3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in the service of thy God.- Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer: for thou hast beheld, that in the fulness of time, he cometh to bring salvation unto men. 

4 And thou hast beheld in thy youth, his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh: for the spirit is the same, yesterday, to-day, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free. 

5 And men are instructed sufficiently, that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law, no flesh is justified; or, by the law, men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law, they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law, they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever. 

6 Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah: for he is full of grace and truth. 

7 Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those which have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered. 

8 Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, which layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise. 

9 Wherefore, he is the first fruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him, shall be saved. 

10 And because of the intercession for all, all men cometh unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of Him, to be judged of Him, according to the truth and holiness which is in Him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement; 

11 for it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my first born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass; neither wickedness;  neither holiness nor misery; neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body, it must neeeds remain as dead, having no life, neither death nor corruption, nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility. 

12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of nought; wherefore, there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God, and his eternal purposes; and also, the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God. 

13 And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness.- And if there be no righteousness, there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness, there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not, there is no God. And if there is no God, we are not, neither the earth: for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away. 

14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things, for your profit and learning: for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them is; both things to act, and things to be acted upon; 

15 and to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after that he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter; 

16 wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man, that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself, save it should be that he were enticed by the one or the other. 

17 And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must needs suppose, that an angel of God, according to that which is written, had fallen from Heaven; wherefore, he became a Devil, having sought that which was evil before God. 

18 And because that he had fallen from Heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind.- Wherefore, he sayeth unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, which is the Devil, which is the father of all lies; wherefore he sayeth, Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil. 

19 And after that Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit, they were  driven out from the garden of Eden, to till the earth. 

20 And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all the earth. 

21 And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he shewed unto all men that they were lost, because of the transgression of their parents. 

22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen; but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created, must have remained in the same state which they were, after that they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. 

23 And they would have had no children; wherefore, they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery: doing no good, for they knew no sin. 

24 But, behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of Him who knoweth all things. 

25 Adam fell, that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. 

26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he might redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall, they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves, and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law, at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given. 

27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which is expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the Devil: for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself. 

28 And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit, 

29 and not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the Devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom. 

30 I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part,  according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other object, save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls.- Amen. 



2 Nephi 03



1 And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last born. Thou wast born in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest sorrow, did thy mother bear thee. 

2 And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, which is a most precious land for thine inheritance and the inheritance of thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so be that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel. 

3 And now, Joseph, my last born, whom I have brought out of the wilderness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever, for thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed. 

4 For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a descendant of Joseph, which was carried captive into Egypt. And great was the covenants of the Lord, which he made unto Joseph; 

5 wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day. And he obtained a promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his loins, the Lord God would raise up a righteous branch unto the House of Israel; not the Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off; nevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants of the Lord, that the Messiah should be made manifest unto them in the latter days, in the spirit of power, unto the bringing of them out of darkness unto light; yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto freedom. 

6 For Joseph truly testified, saying: A seer shall the Lord my God raise up, which shall be a choice seer unto the fruit of my loins. 

7 Yea, Joseph truly said, thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him will I give commandment, that he shall do a work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers. 

8 And I will give unto him a commandment, that he shall do none other work, save the work which I shall command him. And I will make him great in mine eyes: for he shall do my work. 

9 And he shall be great like unto Moses, whom I have said I would raise up unto you, to deliver my  people, O house of Israel. 

10 And Moses will I raise up, to deliver thy people out of the land of Egypt. 

11 But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins; and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them. 

12 Wherefore, the fruit of my loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines, and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days; and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord. 

13 And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord. 

14 And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will the Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him, shall be confounded: for this promise, of which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit of thy loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am sure of the fulfilling of this promise. 

15 And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation; 

16 yea, thus prophesied Joseph. I am sure of this thing, even as I am sure of the promise of Moses: for the Lord hath said unto me, I will preserve thy seed forever. 

17 And the Lord hath said, I will raise up a Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much: for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him. 

18 And the Lord said unto me also, I will raise up unto the fruit of thy loins; and I will make for him a spokesman. And I, behold, I will give unto him, that he shall write the writing of the fruit of thy loins, unto the fruit of thy loins; and the spokesman of thy loins shall declare it. 

19 And the words which he shall write, shall be the words which is expedient in my wisdom, should go forth unto the fruit of thy loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them from the dust: for I know their faith. 

20 And they shall  cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto their brethren, even that after many generations have gone by them. And it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according to the simpleness of their words. 

21 Because of their faith, their words shall proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren, which are the fruit of thy loins; and the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith, unto the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy fathers. 

22 And now, behold, my son Joseph, after this manner did my father of old prophesy. 

23 Wherefore, because of this covenant, thou art blessed: for thy seed shall not be destroyed, for they shall hearken unto the words of the Book. 

24 And there shall raise up one, mighty among them, which shall do much good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and do that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much restoration unto the House of Israel, and unto the seed of thy brethren. 

25 And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little; wherefore, hearken unto the words of thy brother Nephi, and it shall be done unto thee, even according to the words which I have spoken. Remember the words of thy dying father. Amen. 



2 Nephi 04



1 And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken, concerning Joseph, who was carried into Egypt: 

2 For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass. 

3 Wherefore, after my father had made an end of speaking concerning the prophecies of Joseph, he called the children of Laman, his sons, and his daughters, and sayeth unto them, Behold, my sons, and my daughters, which are the sons and the daughters of my first born, I would that ye should give ear unto my words: 

4 for the Lord God hath said, That inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments, ye shall be cut off from my presence. 

5 But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot go down to my  grave, save I should leave a blessing upon you: For behold, I know that if ye are brought up in the right way that ye should go, ye will not depart from it. 

6 Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon you, that the cursing may be taken from you, and be answered upon the heads of your parents. 

7 Wherefore, because of my blessing, the Lord God will not suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you, and unto your seed, forever. 

8 And it came to pass that after my father had made an end of speaking to the sons and daughters of Laman, he caused the sons and daughters of Lemuel to be brought before him. 

9 And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my daughters, which are the sons and the daughters of my second son; behold, I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end, thy seed shall be blessed. 

10 And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them, behold, it came to pass that he spake unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and even all his household. 

11 And after that he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed: for thou shalt inherit the land, like unto thy brother, Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days. 

12 And it came to pass that after Lehi had spake unto all his household, according to the feelings of his heart, and the spirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried. 

13 And it came to pass that not many days after his death, Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, were angry with me, because of the admonitions of the Lord: 

14 for I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to the word. For I had spake many things unto them, and also my father, before his death; many of which sayings, are written upon mine other plates: for a more history part are written upon mine other plates. 

15 And upon these, I write the things of my soul, and many of the Scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass: For my soul deliteth in the Scriptures; and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children. 

16 Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard. 

17 Nevertheless,  notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in shewing me his great and marvellous works, my heart exclaimeth, O wretched man that I am; yea, my heart sorroweth, because of my flesh. My soul grieveth, because of mine iniquities. 

18 I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which doth so easily beset me. 

19 And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted. 

20 My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep. 

21 He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. 

22 He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me. 

23 Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night time. 

24 And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer before him; yea, my voice have I sent upon high; and angels came down and ministered unto me. 

25 And upon the wings of his spirit hath my body been carried away upon exceeding high mountains. And mine eyes hath beheld great things; yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them. 

26 O then, if I have seen so great things; if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men, hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep, and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? 

27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart, to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mineenemy? 

28 Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul. 

29 Do not anger again, because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength, because of mine afflictions. 

30 Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say, O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 

31 O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? 

32 May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite? O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road? 

33 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around  in the robe of thy righteousness? O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies? Wilt thou make my path straight before me? Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way? But that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy. 

34 O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh.- Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm. 

35 Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss: therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. 



2 Nephi 05



1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my God, because of the anger of my brethren. 

2 But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that they did seek to take away my life. 

3 Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinketh to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not that he shall be our ruler: for it belongeth unto us, which are the elder brethren, to rule over this people. 

4 Now I do not write upon these plates, all the words which they murmured against me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to take away my life. 

5 And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should depart from them, and flee into the wilderness, and all they which would go with me. 

6 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother, and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all they which would go with me. And all they which would go with me, were they which believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words. 

7 And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the  space of many days. And after that we had journied for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents. 

8 And my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi. 

9 And all they which were with me, did take it upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi. 

10 And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord, in all things, according to the law of Moses. 

11 And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly: for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind. 

12 And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass, which was prepared for my father, by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written. 

13 And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and to multiply in the land. 

14 And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people which were now called Lamanites, should come upon us and destroy us: for I knew their hatred towards me and my children, and they which were called my people. 

15 And I did teach my people, that they should build buildings; and that they should work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance. 

16 And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon, save it were not built of so many precious things: for they were not to be found upon the land; wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine. 

17 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people that they should be industrious, and that they should labor with their hands. 

18 And it came to pass that they would that I should be their King. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no King; nevertheless, I did do for them according to that which was in my power. 

19 And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their ruler and their teacher; wherefore, I had been their ruler and their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time that they sought to take away my life. 

20 Wherefore, the word of the  Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying: That inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy words, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold, they were cut off from his presence. 

21 And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceeding fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, therefore the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them. 

22 And thus saith the Lord God, I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities. 

23 And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed: for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done. 

24 And because of their cursing which was upon them, they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey. 

25 And the Lord God said unto me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction. 

26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of my people. 

27 And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness. 

28 And thirty years had passed away from the time we left Jerusalem. 

29 And I, Nephi, had kept the records upon my plates, which I had made of my people thus far. 

30 And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me, Make other plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which are good in my sight, for the profit of thy people.- 

31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven these things. 

32 And I engravened that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people be pleased with the things of God, they be pleased with mine engravings which are upon these plates. 

33 And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the history of my people, they must search mine other plates. 

34 And it sufficeth me to say, that forty years had passed away, and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren. 



2 Nephi 06



1 The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi: 

2 Behold, my beloved brethren, that I, Jacob, having been called of God, and ordained after the manner of his holy order, and having been consecrated by my brother, Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king or a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold, ye know that I have spoken unto you exceeding many things; 

3 nevertheless, I speak unto you again: for I am desirous for the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words of my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things which are written from the creation of the world. 

4 And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the words of Isaiah. And they are the words which my brother hath desired me that I should speak unto you. And I speak them unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God. 

5 And now, the words which I shall read, are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the House of Israel; wherefore, they may be likened unto you: for ye are of the House of Israel. And there are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah, which may be likened unto you, because that ye are of the House of Israel. 

6 And now, these are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. 

7 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their faces towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. 

8 And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat concerning these words: For behold, the Lord hath shewn me that they which were at Jerusalem, from whence we came, have been slain and carried away captive; 

9 nevertheless, the Lord hath shewn unto me that they should return again. And he also hath shewn unto me, that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and after that he should manifest himself, they should scourge him and cru cify him, according to the words of the angel, which spake it unto me. 

10 And after that they have hardened their hearts and stiffened their necks against the Holy One of Israel, behold, the judgments of the Holy One of Israel shall come upon them. And the day cometh that they shall be smitten and afflicted. 

11 Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith the angel, many shall be afflicted in the flesh and shall not be suffered to perish, because of the prayers of the faithful: wherefore, they shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be gathered together again to the lands of their inheritance. 

12 And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet hath written: for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church, they shall be saved: for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants which he hath made unto his children; and for this cause, the prophet hath written these things. 

13 Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord, shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are they which wait for him: for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah. 

14 And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second time, to recover them; wherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy that believeth in him. 

15 And they that believe not in him, shall be destroyed, both by fire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by pestilence, and by famine. And they shall know that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel: 

16 for shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? 

17 But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth with thee, 

18 and I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. 



2 Nephi 07



1 Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I  cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement? To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away; 

2 wherefore, when I come, there was no man; when I called, yea, there was none to answer. O House of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke, I dry up the sea, I make their rivers a wilderness and their fish to stink, because the waters are dried up; and they die because of thirst. 

3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. 

4 The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O House of Israel. When ye are weary, he waketh morning by morning. He waketh mine ear to hear as the learned. 

5 The Lord God hath appointed mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. 

6 I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting, 

7 for the Lord God will help me: therefore shall I not be confounded. Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed; 

8 and the Lord is near, and he justifieth me. Who will contend with me? let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? let him come near me, and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth: 

9 for the Lord God will help me. And all they which shall condemn me, behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, and the moth shall eat them up. 

10 Who is among you that feareth the Lord; that obeyeth the voice of his servant; that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? 

11 Behold, all ye that kindleth fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks which ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand: Ye shall lie down in sorrow. 



2 Nephi 08



1 Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness: Look unto the rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence ye are digged. 

2 Look unto Abraham, your father; and unto Sarah, she that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him. 

3 For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste plaees places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody. 

4 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light thing of the people. 

5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arm shall judge the people. The isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. 

6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein, shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever; and my righteousness shall not be abolished. 

7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart I have written my law; fear ye not the reproach of men; neither be ye afraid of their revilings: 

8 for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall be forever; and my salvation from generation to generation. 

9 Awake, awake! Put on strength O arm of the Lord: awake as in the ancient days. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? 

10 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? 

11 Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness shall be upon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy: sorrow and mourning shall flee away. 

12 I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you: Behold, who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of man, which shall die, and of the Son of man, which shall be made like unto grass; 

13 and forgetest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor? 

14 The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.- 

15 But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared: the Lord of Hosts is my name. 

16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and hath covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Behold, thou art my people. 

17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling rung out; 

18 and none to guide her among all the  sons she hath brought forth; neither that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons she hath brought up. 

19 These two sons are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword: And by whom shall I comfort thee?

20 Thy sons have fainted, save these two: they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not with wine: 

22 thus saith thy Lord, The Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again. 

23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which I said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over. 

24 Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee, the uncircumcised and the unclean. 

25 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck; O captive daughter of Zion. 



2 Nephi 09



1 And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord; that he hath covenanted with all the House of Israel; 

2 that he hath spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time cometh that they shall be restored to the true Church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise. 

3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children. 

4 For I know that thou hast searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies, we shall see God. 

5 Yea, and I know that ye  know, that in the body he shall shew himself unto they at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behoveth the Great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man, in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him. 

6 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the Great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord; 

7 wherefore it must needs be an infinite atonement; save it should be an infinite atonement, this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man, must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more. 

8 O the wisdom of God! his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more, our spirits must become subject to that Angel which fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the Devil, to rise no more. 

9 And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become Devils, Angels to a Devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents; who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder, and all manner of secret works of darkness. 

10 O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit. 

11 And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave. 

12 And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up its dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored, one to the other: and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel. 

13 O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us, in the flesh; save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect; 

14 wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness. 

15 And it shall come to pass, that when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the holy judgment of God. 

16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot pass away, that they which are righteous, shall be righteous still, and they which are filthy, shall be filthy still; wherefore, they which are filthy, are the Devil and his angels; and they shall go away into everlasting fire, prepared for them; and their torment is a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames ascendeth up forever and ever, and hath no end. 

17 O the greatness and the justice of our God! For he executeth all his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his law must be fulfilled. 

18 But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, they which have believed in the Holy One of Israel; they which have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it; they shall inherit the Kingdom of God, which was prepared for them from the foundation of the world: and their joy shall be full forever. 

19 O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster, the Devil, and death and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment. 

20 O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not any thing, save he know it. 

21 And he cometh into the world that he may save all men, if they will hearken unto his voice: for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men; yea, the pains of every living creature, both men  women and children, which belong to the family of Adam.- 

22 And he suffereth this, that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him, at the great and judgment day. 

23 And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptised in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the Kingdom of God. 

24 And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be baptised in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned; for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, hath spoken it; 

25 wherefore he hath given a law; and where there is no law given, there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment, there is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation, the mercies of the Holy One of Israel hath claim upon them, because of the atonement: for they are delivered by the power of him: 

26 for the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law given to them, that they are delivered from that awful monster, death and hell, and the Devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them breath, which is the Holy One of Israel. 

27 But wo unto him that hath the law given; yea, that hath all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his probation: for awful is his state! 

28 O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned, they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves. Wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness, and it profiteth them not. Wherefore they shall perish. 

29 But to be learned is good, if it so be that they hearken unto the counsels of God. 

30 But wo unto the rich, which are rich as to the things of the world. For because that they are rich, they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore their treasure is their God. And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also. 

31 And wo unto the deaf, that will not hear: for they shall perish. 

32 Wo unto the blind, that will not see: for they shall perish also. 

33 Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart: for a knowledge of their iniquities shall smite them at the last day. 

34 Wo unto the liar: for he shall be thrust down to hell. 

35 Wo unto the murderer, who deliberately killeth: for he shall die. 

36 Wo unto them who commit whoredoms: for they shall be thrust down to hell. 

37 Yea, wo unto they that worship Idols: for the Devil of all Devils delighteth in them. 

38 And, in fine, wo unto all they that die in their sins: for they shall return to God, and behold his face, and remain in their sins. 

39 O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in transgressing against that holy God, and also the awfulness of yielding to the enticings of that cunning one. Remember, to be carnally minded, is death, and to be spiritually minded, is life eternal. 

40 O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you: for if ye do, ye will revile against the truth: for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear it not, for they love the truth, and are not shaken. 

41 O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy One. Remember that his paths are righteousness. Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel: and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way, save it be by the gate, for he cannot be deceived; for the Lord God is his name. 

42 And whoso knocketh, to him will he open, and the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, which are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches; yea, they are they, whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them. 

43 But the things of the wise and the prudent, shall be hid from them forever; yea, that happiness which is prepared for the Saints. 

44 O my beloved brethren, remember my words: Behold, I take off my garments, and I shake them before you: I pray the God of my salvation that he view me with his All-searching eye; wherefore, ye shall know at the last day, when all men shall be judged of their works, that the God of Israel did witness that I shook your iniquities from my soul, and that I stand with brightness before him, and am rid of your blood. 

45 O my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off the chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God which is the rock of your salvation. 

46 Prepare your souls for that glorious day, when justice shall be administered  unto the righteous; even the day of judgment, that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember your awful guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim, Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty. But I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my transgressions are mine; and the Devil hath obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful misery. 

47 But behold, my brethren, is it expedient that I should awake you to an awful reality of these things? Would I harrow up your souls, if your minds were pure? Would I be plain unto you according to the plainness of the truth, if ye were freed from sin? 

48 Behold, if ye were holy, I would speak unto you of holiness; but as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must needs be expedient that I teach you the consequences of sin. 

49 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart delighteth in righteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God. 

50 Come, my brethren, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price. 

51 Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness. 

52 Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God; pray unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name by night. Let your hearts rejoice, 

53 and behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great his condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his grace and mercy, he hath promised unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he would preserve them; and in future generations, they shall become a righteous branch unto the House of Israel. 

54 And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you more; but on the morrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words. Amen.
